# Creating a Magic Form 
In this project I learned about HTML forms and manipulating DOM objects with JavaScript. I also learned how to store and get data from Localstorage. <br>
Tasks I solved in this challenge: <br> 
After reloading the page, user shouldn't lose any data that was earlier typed in to any of the input fields.<br>
When users open two browser tabs with the HTML form and change data in one of them, the data is also updated in the other tab.<br>
When users click on delete button on history page, it deletes the data related to the button from localstorage as well.<br>
